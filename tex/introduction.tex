\section*{\textsc{\Large Introduction}}

The purpose of this project is to implement a simulator capable of simulating two levels of cache as well as a main memory. The simulator, while it does not actually run instructions given to it, attempts to give an estimate of the timing by giving hits and misses in the cache a set number of cycles. The amount of instructions, cycles, hits, misses, as well as other relevant data are collected for a variety of cache configurations and traces. The simulator is written in C as it has advantages in memory allocation and bit operations.
